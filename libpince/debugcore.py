'''
When PINCE was first launched, it used gdb 7.7.1, which is a very outdated version of gdb
interpreter-exec mi command of gdb showed some buggy behaviour at that time
Because of that, PINCE couldn't support gdb/mi commands for a while
But PINCE is now updated with the new versions of gdb as much as possible and the interpreter-exec works much better
So, old parts of codebase still get their required information by parsing gdb console output
New parts can try to rely on gdb/mi output
'''

'''
Functions that require breakpoint commands, such as track_watchpoint and track_breakpoint, requires process to be
stopped beforehand. If the process is running before we give the breakpoint its commands, there's a chance that the
breakpoint will be triggered before we give it commands. The process must be stopped to avoid this race condition
It's also necessary to stop the process to run commands like "watch"
