When PINCE was first launched, it used gdb 7.7.1, which is a very outdated version of gdb
interpreter-exec mi command of gdb showed some buggy behaviour at that time
Because of that, PINCE couldn't support gdb/mi commands for a while
But PINCE now uses gdb 8.0 and interpreter-exec seems to work much better
So, old parts of codebase still get their required information by parsing gdb console output
New parts can try to rely on gdb/mi output

        File communication system is used to avoid BEL emitting bug of pexpect. If you send more than a certain amount
